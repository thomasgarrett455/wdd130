    <p> Hi! Here is a little bit about me. I am from Bakersfield, California. I attended a community college there where I received
        an associates degree. This is my first semester at BYUI and I am majoring in Computer Science. Right now it is my goal to work 
        law enforcement, but I am still open to pursuing other career paths. I am getting married at the end of next month to my fiance.
        We have been dating for 3 years now! 

        I've been a member of the church my entire life. I served a mission in Cincinnati, Ohio and loved it! One of my favorite quotes
        is from Elder Kearon when he said "God is in relentless pursuit of you". I am very excited to learn about HTML and CSS in this 
        class with each of you!
    </p>
